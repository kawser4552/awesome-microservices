The full form of git is global information tracker.
 It is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in 
 computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple
  people(Wikipedia). Primarily used for source code management in software 
  development but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. 
  Created by  Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. 
  Git thinks about its data. In git nearly every operation is local. 
  Itâ€™s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory 
  without Git knowing about it. When you do actions in Git, nearly 
  all of them only add data to the Git database. In git committed means that 
  the data is safely stored in the database.Modified means that you have 
  changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. 
  Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current 
  version to go into your next commit snapshot.
